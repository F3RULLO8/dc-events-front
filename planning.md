# Plannning
This is the planning page for the dc-events application.
## First Steps
- Decided use Events and Venues as our two models.
- Decided to keep our controllers in the same directory for simplicty.
- Referred to F.I.R.S.T guidelines as we decided to build out our components.
- Aimed to keep a simple attractive design.
## Workflow
- Instead of breaking the project into large chunks (e.g., front-end and back-end) we decided to break the effort up into smaller peices with numerous merges.
- Our code management approach involved each of us having our own branch from which we pushed to common dev and master branches.
